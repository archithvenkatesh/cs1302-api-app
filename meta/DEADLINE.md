## Part 1.1: App Description

> Please provide a friendly description of your app, including
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

The app takes in a US zip code from the user and using an API it is
    able to convert the zipcode into latitudes and longituteds.
    Another API then use those coordinates to get the sunrise
    and sunset times for that location.

## Part 1.2: APIs

> For each RESTful JSON API that your app uses (at least two are required),
> include an example URL for a typical request made by your app. If you
> need to include additional notes (e.g., regarding API keys or rate
> limits), then you can do that below the URL/URI. Placeholders for this
> information are provided below. If your app uses more than two RESTful
> JSON APIs, then include them with similar formatting.

### API 1

```
https://api.zippopotam.us/us/30040
```



### API 2

```
https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat=34.2321&lng=-84.158
```



## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned to use multipe APIs in one project which was new and interesting.
    Connection input and output from different API's was challenging,
    however it made me a better programming.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start differently I would spend more time getting more famililar
    with the formats of the API responses so I wouldn't meet roadblocks as
    I was coding.
